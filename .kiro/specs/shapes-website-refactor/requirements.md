# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves refactoring the existing React-based SHAPES application from a terminal-style interface to a modern, professional website design. The new design features a clean, minimalist aesthetic with sections for About, Method, Workshops, Vision, Why, Get Involved, and Contact. The refactor will maintain the React architecture while completely transforming the user interface and user experience to match the new HTML/CSS design.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor to the SHAPES website, I want to see a modern, professional landing page that clearly communicates what SHAPES is and what it offers, so that I can quickly understand the organization and its mission.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the website THEN the system SHALL display a fixed header with SHAPES logo and navigation menu
2. WHEN a user loads the page THEN the system SHALL show a hero section with tagline, main heading, description, and James Baldwin quote
3. WHEN a user scrolls through the page THEN the system SHALL display all content sections in the correct order (About, Method, Workshops, Vision, Why, Get Involved, Contact)
4. WHEN a user views the page THEN the system SHALL use the exact color scheme, typography, and spacing from the new design

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to navigate smoothly between different sections of the website, so that I can easily find the information I'm looking for.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on navigation links THEN the system SHALL smoothly scroll to the corresponding section
2. WHEN a user hovers over navigation items THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback
3. WHEN a user scrolls THEN the system SHALL maintain the fixed header with backdrop blur effect
4. WHEN a user is on mobile THEN the system SHALL display a responsive navigation that works on smaller screens

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a potential participant, I want to learn about SHAPES' methodology and workshops, so that I can understand how the organization operates and what I can expect.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the Method section THEN the system SHALL display the three-part "Prompt → Play → Reflect" methodology with cards and arrows
2. WHEN a user views the Workshops section THEN the system SHALL show all three workshop types with descriptions
3. WHEN a user hovers over method cards or workshop items THEN the system SHALL provide hover effects as specified in the design
4. WHEN a user views the Vision section THEN the system SHALL display the four vision cards in a grid layout

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As someone interested in getting involved with SHAPES, I want to contact the organization or sign up for activities, so that I can participate in their programs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the Contact section THEN the system SHALL display a functional contact form with all required fields
2. WHEN a user fills out and submits the contact form THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields
3. WHEN a user submits a valid form THEN the system SHALL show a success message and reset the form
4. WHEN a user clicks on "Get Involved" buttons THEN the system SHALL scroll to the contact section
5. WHEN form submission is in progress THEN the system SHALL show loading state on the submit button

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the website to look and function properly, so that I can have a good experience regardless of my screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the site on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a responsive layout that works on screens down to 320px width
2. WHEN a user views the site on tablet THEN the system SHALL adapt grid layouts to single columns where appropriate
3. WHEN a user views the site on desktop THEN the system SHALL display the full multi-column layouts as designed
4. WHEN a user interacts with any element THEN the system SHALL maintain proper touch targets and hover states across devices

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want the new implementation to follow React best practices and be maintainable, so that future updates and modifications are straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the new design THEN the system SHALL use React functional components with hooks
2. WHEN organizing the code THEN the system SHALL break the design into logical, reusable components
3. WHEN styling components THEN the system SHALL use CSS modules or styled-components for maintainable styling
4. WHEN the refactor is complete THEN the system SHALL remove all unused terminal-style components and styles
5. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing build process and deployment configuration
