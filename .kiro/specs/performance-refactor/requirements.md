# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on refactoring the SHAPES React application to eliminate redundancy, improve performance, and modernize the codebase. The current application has duplicate content between a standalone HTML file (remixed.html) and React components, inefficient styling approaches, and opportunities for performance optimization through modern React patterns and build optimizations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the SHAPES application, I want to eliminate code duplication between the standalone HTML and React components, so that I only need to maintain one source of truth for content and styling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN there SHALL be no duplicate file content definitions between remixed.html and React components
2. WHEN updating file content THEN developers SHALL only need to update content in one location
3. WHEN comparing functionality THEN the React application SHALL provide all features currently available in remixed.html
4. IF remixed.html is kept THEN it SHALL be generated from the same data source as the React components

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an end user visiting the SHAPES website, I want the application to load faster and respond more smoothly, so that I can interact with the content without delays or performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the initial page load time SHALL be reduced by at least 30%
2. WHEN interacting with file items THEN hover effects and animations SHALL be smooth without frame drops
3. WHEN opening modals THEN the modal SHALL appear within 100ms of clicking
4. WHEN the application renders THEN it SHALL use efficient React patterns to minimize unnecessary re-renders
5. WHEN assets are loaded THEN they SHALL be optimized for size and delivery

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working on the SHAPES application, I want the codebase to use modern React patterns and best practices, so that the code is maintainable, testable, and follows current standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing components THEN they SHALL use React hooks instead of class components where applicable
2. WHEN managing state THEN the application SHALL use appropriate state management patterns
3. WHEN handling side effects THEN components SHALL use useEffect and other hooks properly
4. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL be properly typed with PropTypes or TypeScript
5. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL follow consistent formatting and linting rules

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer deploying the SHAPES application, I want the build process to be optimized for production deployment, so that the application is delivered efficiently to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for production THEN the bundle size SHALL be minimized through code splitting and tree shaking
2. WHEN deploying THEN static assets SHALL be properly optimized and cached
3. WHEN using Cloudflare Workers THEN the deployment configuration SHALL be optimized for edge delivery
4. WHEN building THEN unused CSS and JavaScript SHALL be eliminated from the final bundle
5. WHEN serving assets THEN they SHALL include appropriate cache headers and compression

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the SHAPES application, I want the styling architecture to be modular and maintainable, so that I can easily update visual designs without affecting other components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing styles THEN CSS SHALL be organized into logical modules or components
2. WHEN updating component styles THEN changes SHALL not affect unrelated components
3. WHEN using animations THEN they SHALL be performant and use CSS transforms/opacity where possible
4. WHEN defining styles THEN there SHALL be no duplicate CSS rules across files
5. WHEN implementing responsive design THEN styles SHALL use efficient media query patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the SHAPES application, I want to reduce the number of files in the codebase by consolidating related functionality, so that the project structure is simpler and easier to navigate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the project structure THEN there SHALL be fewer than 10 total component files
2. WHEN components share similar functionality THEN they SHALL be consolidated into single files with multiple exports
3. WHEN utility functions are needed THEN they SHALL be grouped into shared utility modules
4. WHEN styles are defined THEN related styles SHALL be co-located with their components
5. WHEN the project is organized THEN the file structure SHALL follow a clear, logical hierarchy

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a content manager for SHAPES, I want file content and metadata to be easily manageable through a centralized data structure, so that I can update content without modifying multiple code files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating file content THEN it SHALL be stored in a centralized data structure
2. WHEN adding new files THEN the process SHALL require minimal code changes
3. WHEN modifying file metadata THEN it SHALL be updated in one location
4. WHEN content is displayed THEN it SHALL be consistently formatted across all views
5. WHEN content includes special formatting THEN it SHALL be properly escaped and rendered

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer working on the SHAPES application, I want to eliminate the redundant remixed.html file, so that there is only one application implementation to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the remixed.html file SHALL be removed from the project
2. WHEN users access the application THEN they SHALL only interact with the React-based version
3. WHEN the React application is deployed THEN it SHALL include all visual effects and functionality from remixed.html
4. WHEN animations and styling are implemented THEN they SHALL match or exceed the quality of the original HTML version
5. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL not reference or include the remixed.html file
